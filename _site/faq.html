      <div class="faq_question"><h4>Can I buy a property with funds from my 1031 exchange? </h4></div>
        <div class="faq_answer_container">
          <div class="faq_answer">Yes. Many of our clients sell other investment properties and save tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in capital gains tax payments by reinvesting the proceeds from their sale in a Stratton TIC property. These clients are always thrilled to transition into a passive, cash flowing investment. Stratton properties are specifically structured to qualify for 10 31 exchange treatment. A copy of our legal opinion relating to 10 31 exchange matters is available upon request.

      <div class="faq_question"><h4>What is a Tenancy in Common (TIC)?</h4></div>
        <div class="faq_answer_container">
           <div class="faq_answer"><p>Tenancy in common (TIC) is a form of real estate ownership in which two or more persons buy an undivided, fractional interest in a real estate asset. Each co-owner receives an individual deed at closing for his or her undivided percentage interest in the property. Since each co-owner has an independent deeded interest, said interest can be transferred by gift, sale, inheritance, or assignment independent of the other co-owners. Each co-owner shares in rental income and depreciation tax benefits in proportion to their percentage ownership in the property, as well as the benefit of appreciation in the value of the commercial property. We use the TIC real estate structure to offer shares in high grade commercial investment properties. These properties are normally not available to the average investor because of cost. Through the TIC structure, the average person is able to enjoy ownership in high grade commercial property with reliable income and growth potential. These properties are occupied by national brand corporate tenants with significant financial strength and stability. Each lease is quaranteed by the parent company, so that individual site performance is not a factor. </p>

     <div class="faq_question"><h4>How does TIC investing compare with other popular investment options? </h4></div>
        <div class="faq_answer_container">
          <div class="faq_answer"><p>In today's investment landscape, maximizing return while minimizing risk is hard. The current low interest rates make CDs and money markets unattractive, while stock market volatility is a significant concern. How do TICs compare with these more traditional investment options? </p>
              <ul class="padding">
                 <li>Money Markets and CDs. Traditionally conservative investment instruments like money markets and CDs have very little risk. However, current low interest rates render these investments ineffective, with rates of return that don't even keep up with inflation. </li>
                 <li>Stocks and Bonds. The stock market has historically yielded about an 8% rate of return over the long-haul, but the current market environment is extremely volatile. With stocks at an all-time high, many are wondering when the next market correction will come. </li>
                 <li>Commercial Real Estate (TICs). Our TICs produce a reliable, predictable return on investment that is much higher than for CDs and money market investments, but with similar or lower levels of risk. The following are key advantages to of the TIC properties we offer.</li>
                   <br>

                       <li>•	Consistent return on investment</li>
                       <li>•	Debt free property</li>
                       <li>•	Long term corporate guaranteed leases</li>
                       <li>• Satisfy IRS requirements for 1031 exchange</li>
                       <li>• Tax deferred growth using IRA funds</li>

      <div class="faq_question">  <h4>What are the costs of buying and owning a Rockwell property? </h4> </div>
        <div class="faq_answer_container">
           <div class="faq_answer"><p>Rockwell pays all of the closing costs so that you do not have to pay any fees to buy a property. The only ongoing cost the co-owners incur is the property manager's fee, which is typically only $ 2 5 per month. The tenant pays for the property taxes, insurance and the majority of the repairs and maintenance. </p>

    <div class="faq">
       <div class="faq_question"><h4>How do I get out? </h4> </div>
          <div class="faq_answer_container">
            <div class="faq_answer"><p>Each co-owner receives an undivided, fractional interest in the property so each has the right to sell his portion at any point in time. The tenancy-in­common agreement gives the other co-owners the first right to buy if one of the co-owners decides to sell. The resale of a TIC interest in a debt-free property is made easier because a new buyer does not have to qualify for an existing loan. All of the co-owners can also agree to sell the entire property whenever they choose. A TIC ownership can be listed with a real estate broker or sold by owner. Rockwell can also serve as a resource for a past client seeking to sell his fractional interest. </p>

    <div class="faq">
      <div class="faq_question"><h4>Who manages the property? </h4> </div>
        <div class="faq_answer_container">
           <div class="faq_answer">  <p>Rockwell helps the co-owners to get an experienced, professional property manager into place. The property manager ensures that the tenant complies with the terms of the lease, coordinates communication, distributes the monthly lease payments to the co-owners and prepares regular reports and tax statements. </p>

    <div class="faq">
      <div class="faq_question">  <h4>When do I get paid? </h4> </div>
          <div class="faq_answer_container">
            <div class="faq_answer">  <p>The property manager sends a payment to each co-owner during the first week of each month in the form of a mailed check or direct deposit into your bank account. </p>

      <div class="faq_question"><h4>How are decisions made? </h4> </div>
        <div class="faq_answer_container">
           <div class="faq_answer"><p>Upon closing, a tenancy-in-common agreement is executed that outlines the relationship among the co-owners and how decisions are to be made. In short, minor decisions are made by a majority vote while major decisions are made by a unanimous vote. For practical purposes however, because the tenant and lease are already established before the co-owners purchase an interest, there are very few decisions to be made. </p>

       <div class="faq_question"><h4>How many co-owners are there in an average property? </h4> </div>
          <div class="faq_answer_container">
            <div class="faq_answer"><p>Rockwell properties are designed to be smaller in scale than those offered by other TIC sponsors. While many TIC properties have thirty or more co-owners, most Rockwell properties have fewer than ten. </p>

    <div class="faq">
      <div class="faq_question"><h4>What is the worst case scenario?</h4> </div>
        <div class="faq_answer_container">
          <div class="faq_answer"><p>The worst case scenario would be if the tenant went out of business and there were an interruption in the lease payments. However, because there is no debt to service you would not be in danger of losing the property and thereby your original investment. In this circumstance the co-owners could elect to have the property manager find a buyer or a new tenant to lease the property. By design, Stratton properties are smaller, freestanding buildings which are typically much easier to lease than a larger facility. It is important to point out that Stratton only works with strong corporate tenants with excellent track records and proven business models. To date, no Rockwell property owner has ever missed a monthly payment. </p>

      <div class="faq_question">  <h4>Can I buy a property with my IRA or other retirement account? </h4> </div>
        <div class="faq_answer_container">
          <div class="faq_answer">  <p>Yes. Many Americans are taking a more active role in their retirement planning. Self-directed IRAs and other similar programs allow you to decide where to invest your money. A Rockwell property is a tremendous option for your retirement account as it is designed to provide security and a very predictable, reliable return on your investment. </p>
