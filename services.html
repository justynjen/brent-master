      <h4 class="padding">"The 1031 Exchanger" has property that they are reliquishing and makes an agreement with a Qualified Intermediary to facilitate the 1031 exchange.</h4>
      <h4>When the property is sold, proceeds from the sale are wired to the Qualified Intermediary for holding while a replacement property is identified and purchased.</h4>
      <h4 class="padding">The "1031 Exchanger" chooses a property and identifies it as their replacement property within a 45 day time frame after the close of the relinquished property, as per the IRS rules.</h4>
      <h4>The "1031 Exchanger" completes the transaction within the 180-day window required bu the IRS, by closing on the Stratton Investments replacement property they have previously identified.</h4>
