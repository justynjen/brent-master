</div>
<div>
<h5>The Tenant</h5>
<p class="padding">Fresenius Medical Care is the world’s leading provider
of products and services for people with chronic kidney failure. Worldwide, more than 2.5 million patients with this disease regularly undergo dialysis therapy, a vital blood cleansing procedure that substitutes the function of the kidney in the case of kidney failure.
Through their industry-leading network of more than 3,500 dialysis facilities, outpatient cardiac and vascular labs, and urgent care centers, as well as the country’s largest practice of hospitalist and post-acute providers, Fresenius Medical Care provides coordinated health care services at pivotal care points for hundreds of thousands of chronically ill customers throughout the continent. As the world’s only vertically integrated renal company, they also offer specialty pharmacy and laboratory services, as well as manufacturing and distributing the most comprehensive line of dialysis equipment, disposable products and renal pharmaceuticals. Their integrated approach helps to not only improve patients’ health outcomes, but also reduce the total cost of care. Around the world, they care for more than 290,000 renal patients in our global network of more than 3,500 dialysis clinics. At the same time, they operate more than 40 production sites on five continents, to provide dialysis products such as dialysis machines, dialyzers and related disposables.</p>

<h5>The Lease</h5>
<p class="padding">Fresenius Medical Care has committed to lease the property for an initial term of 15 years, which expires the end December 2031. During the initial term of the lease the base rent shall increase by 1.7% annually. The lease also includes three consecutive options to extend the lease for a period of 5 years each.
One of the more appealing aspects of this lease is that Fresenius Medical Care pays directly or reimburses all of the taxes, insurance premiums and maintenance costs of the building. Fresenius pays the Tenant’s share of the operating expenses incurred by the Landlord during the term of the lease. Therefore, the property co-owners have very few active management duties rendering this triple-net lease property a passive, hassle-free, real estate investment.</p>

<p class="padding">This brand new 7,256 square foot building is a very attractive brick structure that was completed in February 2017. The parking lot has spaces for 33 vehicles including four spots for the physically challenged. The interior is designed to be low-maintenance and boasts state-of-the-art equipment and amenities. Fresenius Medical Care North America has committed to a long-term lease with an initial period of 15-years and three 5-year renewal options to follow.
Farr West is a beautiful suburb of the thriving Ogden, Utah Metropolitan Area. The city of Ogden is located at the Northern end of the vaunted Watch Front Region, which
is home to some 2.5 million residents, roughly 80% of Utah’s population. Ogden serves as a regional economic hub for northern Utah. The Internal Revenue Service has a large presence in Ogden and is the city’s largest employer. The Business Depot Ogden, formerly an army depot, was restructured to be a 1,000-plus acre business park and is home to numerous companies. The city offers all the benefits of urban life, along with incredible access to the outdoors. Residents enjoy a very high quality of life and low cost of living. Ogden is home to Weber State University, Ogden-Weber Applied Technology College and Stevens-Henager College. The area was recently named by Forbes Magazine as one of the “best places for business and careers” and “best cities for raising a family.”</p>

<div class="padding"> Included in the floor plan are the following; a large patient treatment area, reception area and business office with adjoining records room, waiting room, conference room, break room with full kitchen, private restrooms, exam room, large storage area, water treatment equipment room, classroom-style corporate training center and private offices for the on-site social worker and dietitian. In addition to the dialysis-related medical equipment, each of the treatment stations has its own large, flat screen monitor that can be used to watch television or movies or access the Internet while the patient is treated. The layout of the building makes for very efficient use of the space. The interior and exterior are very clean and well-maintained and provide a comfortable and inviting environment for staff and patients alike.
Although this a brand-new clinic, Fresenius has already established the tremendous demand that exists in the community and have many regular patients ready to start receiving treatments three times per week. Initially they will operate shifts on Monday, Wednesday and Friday with plans to add shifts on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday in the near future as the patient base grows.
In summary, because this is a brand-new medical facility providing a vital life-sustaining service to a population with an ever-increasing need, Fresenius plans to be in this clinic serving the people of this community for a very long time into the future.
